# Lovely World

Palette: Island Joy 16x https://lospec.com/palette-list/island-joy-16

## TODO

- why did throwing break
- scene transitions- keep held item
- fix check for free area when throwing/dropping
- use kittenboat musicmanager for peristent bgm transition

- items
	- ladders
	- torches- melt ice above you, light in darkness
		- throw and slide along ice puzzle
	- tp crystal- when dropped, teleports you to where you picked it up (but doesn't bring crystal with you)
	- parachute- slow fall to cross gaps
		- throw across gap puzzle
		- glide back to wall for multiple walljumps
	- keys & locked doors
	- reset crystal- respawns everything in room
		- except if you're holding it? (quickly pick up item to prevent its reset)
		- use key from one room on multiple doors in another
		- what if you're inside door?
	- frog with sticky tongue- grapple on ceiling
		- activated by jump key? or up/down? or on timer?

- up/down keys: look up/squat down
- slippery ice
- non euclidean room transitions
- item spawn rule manipulation
- moving platforms (run/jump/throw momentum)
- everything serves at least two purposes
- progression: world state change, carried item, knowledge of secrets, collectible hearts
- enemies
- npcs with dialog (mintty)

- no walljump while holding item?
- throw object in midair pushes you back?- sorta double jump

- world
	- center- veggie garden + love + magic (starting area)
	- left- tide pools & cliffs (octopus, crab etc.)
	- up- popsicle ice zone (fruits?)
	- right- gears jungle (robots)
	- down- hollow earth cave (bigfoot, faceless birds, atlantis etc.)
	- way up- saturn palace
